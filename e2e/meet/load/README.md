# Meet Measurement Harness

This is a bounded measurement client for the current SFU signaling contract. Every
artifact says `qualified: false`. A successful local run proves only that its own
synthetic Participant Connections joined, optionally exchanged media, and cleaned
up. It is not a capacity, production-browser, source-fidelity, bitrate, or recorder
result.

## Safety

- The default target is loopback port 3001. Port 3000 is always rejected because it
  is the shared development SFU. Non-loopback targets require
  `--allow-remote-target`, which represents explicit operator authorization.
- Runs require an idle `/health` and authenticated `/metrics` before sending traffic.
  The unique default Meet Room and `load.test` site namespace identify run-owned
  resources. Counts are bounded to 1-150, holds to 1-600 seconds, and ramps to 0-5000
  milliseconds. Cleanup polling defaults to 65 seconds and is bounded to 90.
- JWTs and metrics credentials come from named environment variables or a JSONL
  token file. They are not accepted on the command line, written to reports, or
  included in raw errors. Output and conventional token files are denied by Vite.
- Cleanup stops local tracks, closes only harness browsers/server, emits `leave_room`,
  then verifies SFU health, resource gauges, and local tracks returned to idle.

## Run

Use an isolated SFU configured with the same random secrets and a non-3000 port:

```bash
SFU_LOAD_JWT_SECRET=local-secret SFU_METRICS_TOKEN=local-metrics \
  yarn --cwd e2e load:meet --sfu-url http://127.0.0.1:4317 \
  --count 2 --media none --duration-seconds 2 \
  --output /tmp/meet-load-local.json
```

`--scenario representative-camera` publishes deterministic first `--cameras`
(default `min(40, count)`, maximum 40) Participant Connections and leaves the rest
idle. Each camera is a moving, time-coded 1280x720 canvas captured at a requested 30
fps; it does not use Chromium's generic fake camera. Reports keep requested source
properties separate from observed track settings, sender `outbound-rtp` bytes,
`framesEncoded` and fps, `media-source` dimensions/fps, and every eager receiver's
`inbound-rtp` bytes, decoded frames, dimensions, and fps. Missing browser stats are
`null`; short runs do not establish bitrate or sustained fps. Producer IDs, enabled
and unpaused state, RTP/frame progression, decoded delivery when exposed, and SFU
Producer/Consumer counts are checked across the hold window. One muted 1x1 off-screen
video probe per Participant Connection drives playback and exposes Chromium's browser
decoded-frame count; this avoids O(N) rendered elements. Full rendering remains off
unless explicitly requested.

`--scenario representative-screen` publishes the first `--screens` Participant
Connections (default `min(2, count)`, maximum 2) as distinct moving, time-coded
1920x1080 canvases captured at requested 30 fps. Producers use screen semantics and
an encoding `maxBitrate` target of 4,000,000 bps; the configured target is reported
separately from elapsed-window sender and receiver bitrate observations. Every
intended receiver renders every screen for a browser decoded-frame probe. Stable
Producer identity/state, delivery, progress, eager SFU resources, dimensions, fps,
and nullable WebRTC stats are reported. For windows of at least five seconds an
observed sender average over the cap plus 10% tolerance fails correctness, but the
target is not a strict instantaneous network ceiling and a short local run does not
establish sustained <=4 Mbps.

`--media audio|video|both` uses Chromium's synthetic fake devices. Reports retain
actual capture settings and observed RTP byte counters, but synthetic devices do not
model representative speech/cameras and requested settings do not prove delivered
resolution, frame rate, or bitrate. `--consume none` isolates publication.

`--scenario rotating-audio --media audio` gives every participant one persistent,
enabled, unpaused microphone Producer sourced from a 440 Hz Web Audio oscillator.
Only a `GainNode` changes: `--talkers` (default 10, never above `--count`) rotate on
the configured `--rotation-interval-ms` cadence. Reports include each expected
active set, actual gain-state boundaries and duration, per-publisher outbound RTP and
optional audio-energy deltas, per-receiver inbound continuity, Producer IDs, and SFU
Producer/Consumer gauges for every window.
Configured gain is not proof of acoustic delivery; `totalAudioEnergy` is recorded
when Chromium exposes it, otherwise the report says `null`.

Server measurements need a dedicated authorized SFU, valid full-scope participant
tokens matching the generated room/site (or its signing secret), and authenticated
Prometheus metrics. A token file contains exactly `--count` JSONL rows shaped as
`{"userId":"...","name":"...","token":"..."}`. Reports record endpoint,
loopback classification, resolved workload, browser/host identity, generator process
resource deltas, before/hold/after SFU resource gauges, participant observations, and
cleanup outcome.

## Progressive Scenarios

Admission plus idle hold, uniform synthetic media, rotating audio, representative
camera, two-screen, and Recorder Endpoint measurement are implemented. Pinned
representative video and actual delivered video constraints remain before those
properties are claimed.

The focused Recorder Endpoint measurement uses the existing containerized recorder
integration service because recorder capture requires Linux Xvfb and PulseAudio:

```bash
yarn --cwd suite/meet/recorder-server measure:recorder
```

It starts only Compose-owned SFU and recorder integration containers, uses an
ephemeral proof-bound Recording Grant, and composes four human Participant
Connections: two alternating synthetic talkers with one camera each, plus two screen
publishers. The Recorder Endpoint attaches through production WebRTC and is excluded
from the human participant count. The ignored `integration/output/shared-stage`
report records grant-to-ready and ready-to-capture latency, capture and encoded
duration, interruption count, artifact size, ffprobe video resolution/fps and audio
presence, full decode warnings, content samples, and process cleanup.

This is designed as an honest local integration scenario, not a production result. Deterministic
publishers use development-only plain RTP ingress, and the fixture drives current
recorder classes rather than the HTTP control endpoint because that endpoint's stop
path finalizes through authenticated Frappe/Drive callbacks unavailable in this
standalone harness. SFU attachment, browser composition, capture, and the artifact
are real and are not mocked when the scenario completes successfully.

## Verification

```bash
yarn --cwd e2e test:meet-load
yarn --cwd e2e typecheck
yarn knip:e2e
yarn check:meet-types
yarn test:meet-type-policy
git diff --check
```
