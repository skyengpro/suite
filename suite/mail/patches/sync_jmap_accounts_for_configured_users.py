    The Account Settings -> JMAP Account rename (rename_account_settings_to_jmap_account)
    keeps every row and its configured values (screening, remote-image blocking, junk
    handling, outgoing settings, last active sieve) intact. But the rename also introduced
    identity fields (account_id, _name, is_personal, is_readonly) that are empty on existing
    rows, and the per-user "User Account" links don't exist yet.

    Existing rows are already named by the bare account ID (the shared-per-account reshape
    shipped in an earlier release), so account_id is backfilled from the doc name inline: this
    keeps each row the canonical, valid document for its account, which is what stops
    sync_jmap_accounts from creating a fresh, empty duplicate and wiping the user's config.

    The rest needs a live JMAP session, which isn't reliably reachable during `bench migrate`,
    so it's deferred to a background job: reconnect per configured user (username set), run
    sync_jmap_accounts to create the User Account links and add docs for any brand-new
    accounts, then backfill the session-derived identity fields on the pre-existing docs
    without touching their configuration.
