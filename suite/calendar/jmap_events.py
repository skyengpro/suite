"""Calendar-domain JMAP helpers built on jmaplib.

Ports the payload building and recurrence/instance logic that used to live in
``CalendarEventService``. Every function takes an already-scoped client (see
``suite.mail.jmap.get_account_client``); mutators return the typed ``SetResponse`` (or a
merged ``SetResult`` for chunked calls) so callers read failures via
``suite.mail.jmap.get_set_error_message``.

    For rewriting the map as a whole — re-keying every override after the series it belongs
    to has moved. Anywhere that touches a single occurrence must patch that occurrence's key
    instead, so a copy of the map taken before someone else's write cannot undo it.
