"""Signed RSVP links for custom event invitations.

An invitation email carries three signed links (Yes / Maybe / No) that point at the
`event_rsvp` web page. `resolve_rsvp` verifies the token and writes the participant's
response to the organizer's copy of the event via JMAP. Recipients may be on any mail
server, so we never require a login — the signed token is the only authorization.

Participants hosted on this site each hold their own copy of the event (created when the
invite email was delivered), so after the organizer's copy is updated a background job
propagates the response to those copies too — otherwise everyone but the organizer keeps
seeing the stale status.
