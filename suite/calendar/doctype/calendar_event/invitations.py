"""Client-side calendar invitation delivery.

When custom event invites are enabled (Mail Settings), the app sends invitation, update,
and cancellation emails itself instead of letting the JMAP server emit iMIP scheduling
mail. Each email carries an .ics (iTIP REQUEST/CANCEL) plus signed HTTP RSVP links.

Entry point: `notify_participants(account, action, ...)`, enqueued from the Calendar Event
API after the event is written to JMAP.
