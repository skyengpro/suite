"""Expansion of mailing list participants into the list's individual members.

Stalwart resolves a mailing list at the SMTP RCPT stage: `team@example.com` is replaced by each
member's own address before delivery, and the list address is not part of any account's identity.
An iTIP ATTENDEE naming the list therefore matches nobody on ingest, so members receive the
invitation mail but the event is never added to their calendars. Groups behave differently only
because a group is a real principal with its own address and its own calendar.

Adding one participant per member before the event is stored is what RFC 5546 asks the organizer
to do, and it fixes both invite paths at once: Frappe Mail's own invitation mails and the JMAP
server's scheduling messages are both built from the stored participant list. Each member also
ends up with a distinct participant uid, which is what gives them individual RSVP links.

The list itself stays on the event as a group participant that is never scheduled (`scheduleAgent`
none), and every member added for it points back at the list through `memberOf` (RFC 8984,
section 4.4.6). That link lets an invitation reach a member with the list in its To header, the
way any other mail to the list arrives, and it marks which participants were derived from a list
rather than named by the organizer.

Membership is resolved every time the event is saved: members no longer on the list are dropped
(the invitation code then mails them a cancellation), new members are added, and the rest keep
their participant entry along with the response recorded against it.

    The size cap bounds the event's total participants, but only members added by expansion are ever
    dropped to honour it. A participant the organizer named themselves is always kept, even when
    that pushes the total past the cap, because dropping one removes them from the stored
    event, and on the next update the invitation code reads that as a withdrawn attendee and mails
    them a cancellation. For the same reason an explicit participant always wins over the same
    address arriving through a list, no matter which order they appear in: the explicit entry
    carries the uid their RSVP is recorded against, and a member entry would reset it.
