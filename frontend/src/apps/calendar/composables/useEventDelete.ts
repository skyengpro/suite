 *
 * @param getEvent - The event to delete. A getter, so the caller can hand over
 *   a prop it destructured, and so the menu follows the selection as it moves;
 *   it may return nothing while none is selected.
 * @param onDeleted - What the host does once the server confirms: reload the
 *   calendar, close itself.
 * @returns `deleteOption` for the host's own dropdown, `isDeleting` for the
 *   trigger's disabled state, the three pieces of the scope question a
 *   recurring event asks first (`showScopeModal`, `deleteScopeModalProps`,
 *   `deleteScope`), and the three of the cancellation-email prompt that follows
 *   it: `showNotifyModal`, `pendingDelete` and `NOTIFY_DELETE_OPTIONS`.
