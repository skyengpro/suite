	     events read at four ranges.

	     The week was the last of them to arrive. Seven columns at 390px leave a

		     hamburger opens the view switcher, where mail's opens its folders:
		     which list you are looking at is the same question in both.

		     The rule under it is the bar's own, drawn where the bar meets content:
		     the day and the agenda, whose views draw none at their top (`noBorder`
		     sees to that). The week and the month open with a row of weekday
		     names, which is the bar's second line — a title, then its dates, then
