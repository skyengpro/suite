	<!--
	  The event form as a phone screen. The desktop dialog at 390px keeps every affordance
	  and fits none of them: the alert sentence wraps, Availability and Visibility share a
	  row at ~120px each, and Save sits inside the scroll, below the participants. Here each
	  field takes a row of its own and the header always holds Save. Participants follow the
	  time rather than closing the form: who is coming is settled with when it is, and the
	  desktop's own layout says as much — a column beside the details, not below them.
	  Anything that needs a choice — repeat, alert, visibility, participants — opens a sheet
	  or a screen of its own rather than an inline dropdown.

	  Fixed and sized to the *visible* viewport rather than left in flow, for the reasons
	  mail's ComposeView spells out: the suite shell's <main> is itself a scroller and iOS
	  pans the visible area to reveal a focused field, either of which carries a header left
	  in flow off the top of the screen.

		     the right and goes back out to it; the form goes out to the left and comes
		     back from there — a push both ways, the way the detail sheet turns its
		     pages. The one on its way out is lifted out of the flow so the arriving
		     one has the box from the first frame, and the fixed root clips the pair;
		     see the style block. v-show, not v-if, so the form keeps its scroll
		     position and any field mid-edit while the reader is away. -->

					     each screen, so the mark on the left and the title beside it land on the
					     same two pixels either way — two headers with the same numbers written twice
					     is a thing that stays aligned only until one of them is edited.

					     What differs is the mark and what it does. The form is a surface over the
					     calendar and leaving it discards the event, which is a cross; the
					     participants screen is pushed from the form and steps back to it, which is
