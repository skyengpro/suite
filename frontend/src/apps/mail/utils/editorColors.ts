// The editor writes a named colour as `color: var(--prose-color-blue)`, and that variable is only
// ever defined inside `.ProseMirror`. Everywhere else the declaration is invalid and the text falls
// back to the inherited colour: the recipient's client shows black, and so does our own reader,
// which renders the body in an iframe that never sees the app's stylesheet. That is why a
// coloured line reads as uncoloured in Sent — the sender's copy is stripped just like the
// recipient's is.
//
// So the variable has to be resolved to a literal colour before the body leaves the editor.
//
// Deliberately the light-scheme value, not the current theme's: a sent mail is a fixed document,
// and the reader remaps light-scheme mail onto the dark canvas at display time (see darkMail.ts).
// Baking dark colours into the wire format would defeat that and reach the recipient wrong.
//
// The values are frappe-ui's own — `textColorHexMap` and `highlightColorHexMap` in
// TextEditor/extensions/shared/color-utils.ts. They are copied rather than imported because that
// module isn't in frappe-ui's package exports. They double as the extension's own legacy parse
// map, so a body written this way still reads back as a named colour when a draft is reopened.

// Text colour and highlight are separate marks, so colouring a highlighted run nests them:
// `<span style="color: …"><mark style="background-color: …">`. That looks right in the editor
// and is wrong the moment it leaves, because every browser's default stylesheet gives <mark> its
// own `color`, and a colour set *on* the element beats one inherited from an ancestor. The
// highlight survives, the text colour is overruled, and the words come out black on the
// background — which is exactly what Gmail shows.
//
// `inherit` is the fix rather than the resolved hex, because it is correct whichever way round
// the two marks happen to nest, and it is a no-op when the run isn't coloured at all. Marks that
// already carry a colour of their own are left alone.
// Mail carried into a reply or a forward is somebody else's document, and a <mark> in it was
// written expecting the browser default we would be overriding — so `inherit` there could recolour
// their words from whatever element happens to enclose the block. Left alone.
//
// All three spellings: our own quote and forward wrappers (MailThread's getQuotedContent and
// getForwardedContent) and Gmail's. Matching on the wrapper rather than on which field the HTML
// arrived in is what makes this hold — openQuotedContent folds the quote straight into html_body,
// so by the time this runs the composed and carried-over parts are one string.
