// window lives — and it is the layout that knows a request means the dock on desktop and the
// compose page on mobile.
//
// Compose means "a new mail", always — never the draft already in the corner. A composer that is
// open loses the window to this one and closes, which costs it nothing: it saves what it holds on
// the way out, and the draft is waiting in Drafts. Reaching back for it instead made the button
// answer a request nobody had made, and left no way at all to start a second mail.
