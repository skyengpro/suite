/**
 * The two halves of a thread list view: the list column, and the reading pane beside/over it.
 *
 * Both halves are sized from one setting and one "is a thread open" flag, which is exactly why they
 * live in one component: every geometry rule here (column against pane, overlay against split,
 * the mobile slide) is a statement about the pair. Kept apart, the mailbox list and the merged All
 * Inboxes list each grew their own copy and the copies drifted — the merged one shipped without the
 * Teleport, so the mobile tab bar painted over its pane.
 *
 * The list content goes in `#list`, the thread in the default slot. Both are the caller's — this
 * owns nothing but the frame.
