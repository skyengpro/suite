 * replace-on-reload can never fight the append — which is why this owns the bookkeeping BETWEEN them
 * (the epochs, the refresh merge, the removal suppression) rather than the resources themselves,
 * whose urls, params and payload shapes differ per view.
 *
 * Both views had a line-for-line copy of all of it, comments included, and the copies had already
 * drifted: the merged list was missing the removal suppression (a thread archived mid-refresh
 * reappeared) and the edge crossing (prev/next in the reading pane stopped dead at the last loaded
 * thread instead of paging).
 *
 * The caller must render `ref="mailList"` on the scroll container and `ref="loadMoreSentinel"` on a
 * zero-height element after the last row, and must call `topUpIfShort` from a watcher on its rendered
 * rows (see that function — the watcher has to sit below the rows it reads).

	 * further windows would be too. Appends normally extend the last date group, which can't be

	 *
	 * And the episode's window budget, for the fill that makes progress forever without ever filling:
