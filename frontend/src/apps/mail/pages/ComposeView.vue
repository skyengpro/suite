<template>
	<!--
	  Mobile compose: a header pinned to the top, and one scrolling region filling everything from
	  under it down to the keyboard. Nothing else.

	  The page is `fixed` and sized to the *visible* area rather than left in flow, because in flow it
	  could be moved by things it doesn't control — the suite shell's `<main>` is itself a scroller,
	  and iOS pans the visible area to reveal a focused field. Either one carried the header off the
	  top of the screen. `sticky` on the header couldn't help: it resolves against `<main>` and rides
	  up out of it too. `100dvh` can't size this either — dvh answers to browser chrome, not to the
	  keyboard — so the height is measured.

	  `top` follows how far iOS has panned, so the page lands back on the visible area once a pan
	  settles; without it the header ends up under the status bar and stays there.

	  Being fixed is what made the old compose sheet pan in the first place, but only because there
	  was nothing inside it for iOS to scroll instead. There is now — and `focusWithoutReveal` below
	  takes focus into its own hands so iOS never starts the pan to begin with.
